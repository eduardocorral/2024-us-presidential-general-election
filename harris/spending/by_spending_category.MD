# HARRIS FOR PRESIDENT

## Explanation of "Spending by Category" Table

**Purpose of the Table**: The goal was to estimate how much was spent in various categories, such as "Media & Advertising," "Consulting & Strategy," and "Hotels." Since each expenditure might serve multiple purposes, we looked at each transaction and tried to determine which categories it might fit into based on keywords in the description or recipient name.

**Double-Counting Approach**: For example, if a single expenditure was for "Consulting" but was also related to "Media," we counted it in both "Consulting & Strategy" and "Media & Advertising." This double-counting was intentional to give a full picture of spending possibilities in each area, even if an expenditure overlaps categories.

**Resulting Totals**: Because of this approach, the sum of "Total Amount Disbursed" in the table is higher than the actual total amount spent. Each expenditure might appear more than once if it’s associated with multiple categories.

**Limitations of This Estimate**: This table is meant to give an idea of where money could have been allocated, but it doesn’t perfectly capture the exact purpose behind each expense. Without more detail, it’s hard to know precisely how each dollar was used, so this table provides an estimated breakdown based on descriptive information rather than concrete allocations.

Also, please note that the descriptions in Harris for President campaign filings contain fewer details compared to the descriptions in the Trump campaign’s filings, which provide more specificity. As a result, this approach was necessary to estimate spending areas without precise allocation information.

*The methodology for estimating total possible disbursements across spending categories varies between the Trump and Harris campaigns, reflecting differences in the specificity of disbursement descriptions and the potential informational value of recipient names. This variation impacts the interpretability and granularity of expenditure classification across categories for each campaign.*
